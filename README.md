# hubl
Implementation of HubL using Nunjucks

It's important to note that a fair few of the HUBL tags pull data from the Hubspot CRM/CMS. These methods have been implemented as stubs.




See src/test.js for example.


## Why? 
I want to be able to test my modules using Jest.

## todo:

1. support hubl in scss
2. integrate all key filters
3. integrate all functions
4. integrate all tags
5. allow hooks for any methods which use data from hubspot - allowing data to be populated from the API (build a static version of the site), nots sure this is possible yet though.
